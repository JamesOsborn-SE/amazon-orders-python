# Amazon Orders

`amazon-orders` is an unofficial library that provides a command line interface alongside a programmatic API that can
be used to interact with your Amazon orders and returns.

## Installation

`amazon-orders` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/amazon-orders/) and can be installed using `pip`:

```sh
pip install amazon-orders
```

or `conda`:

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge amazon-orders
```

That's it! `amazon-orders` is now available as a Python package is available from the command line.

## Basic Usage

`amazon-orders` is under active development, and at present does nothing. But soon it will be functional, and this
README will be updated then.
